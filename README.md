# WEEK 5 Assignment - Daily Planner
In this weeks task we were required to build a daily planner that allowed users to save their daily task over the hours of a standard work day. As the time progressed through the day, the elements styling changes the colours signify current tasks and then past and future.


## Notes 
This assignment introduced me to a lot of new shorthand methods. It was good to find examples of these shorthands and research how they worked and then test them in this planner.
